## How to type ∆í
Use `option+F`.

## Features
1. I made the function ∆í that receives bash commands as string templates, and choose to execute them in the foreground or background according to context.
2. The beginning two characters ∆í-backtick are __automatically put in__, and can be changed; The final backtick is also auto-completed. This makes it no hard than using a bash.
3. When the command is executed directly, it is interactive with full compatibility like a normal bash; when nested in expressions, they are just hidden and still interactive. This is a feature. Try typing:
    ```
    ∆í`vim`.length
    ```
    and then use your mind and keyboard to quit it.
4. Fully customizable. If it's not full enough, edit the code and don't be worried about not understanding bash syntaxes.
